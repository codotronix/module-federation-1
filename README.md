# Module Federation with CRA 

Here I explore *Webpack Module Federation* with `create-react-app`
- with `eject`
- without `eject` using `craco`

In this example codebase I first ejected 2 react cra apps `app1` and `app3`

And then after studying them, I created a 3rd one `app2` which is not ejected can easily pull and also share code chunks with `app1`
